# Creation of a website for World of Warcraft farmers.

As part of a school project, we created a website that enables **World of Warcraft** players to access mounts and equipments from the game **very easily**, using **filters**. 
The player can also **create an account** and access it using his/her email address and password. When accessing the account, **all the mounts and equipments** that the player previsouly added to his cart are displayed. He can indeed choose to add a specific item to his favorites, and access it anytime later on. The website was created using **PHP** and a **mySQL** database.

## The main objectives of this website is to easily access all the mounts and equipments with a wide range of filters. The player must be able to find his favorite item very quickly.

There are two specific pages for both the mounts and the equipments :
